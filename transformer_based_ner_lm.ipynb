One challenge in machine translation on this domain is that hotel descriptions contain a lot of named entities. For example, a description may mention the name of the hotel, the street it is located on, or nearby landmarks. One approach to dealing with entities in translation is to detect them in the input document, substitute them with a placeholder, run the translation model, and back-substitute the translated entity in the output document.
